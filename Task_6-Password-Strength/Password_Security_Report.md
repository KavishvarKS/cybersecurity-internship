# Password Strength Analysis

## Objective
Evaluate a list of passwords with varying complexity, identify best practices for strong password creation, understand common password attacks, and analyze how complexity affects security.

## Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
- **Length matters** – Aim for at least **12–16 characters**; longer is better.
- **Use character variety** – Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- **Avoid personal info** – Don’t use birthdays, names, or common phrases.
- **No dictionary words** – Reduces risk of dictionary attacks.
- **Use passphrases** – Combine unrelated words with symbols (e.g., `Purple$Ocean!Runs@Night`).
- **Unique per account** – Never reuse passwords across sites.
- **Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** – Adds another layer of protection.
- **Consider a password manager** – Stores and generates complex passwords safely.

##  Tips Learned from Evaluation
- Short passwords, even with symbols, are weak if predictable.
- Adding **more length** is more effective than adding more symbols alone.
- Random combinations are stronger than modified dictionary words.
- Passphrases can be both strong and memorable.
- Changing just one character in a weak password doesn’t make it strong.
- The time to crack increases exponentially with length and randomness.

##  Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack** – Tries every possible character combination until the password is guessed.  
  *Defense*: Use long, complex passwords to make brute forcing impractical.
  
- **Dictionary Attack** – Uses a list of common words, phrases, and leaked passwords to guess quickly.  
  *Defense*: Avoid dictionary words and common patterns.

- **Credential Stuffing** – Uses stolen username/password pairs from previous breaches.  
  *Defense*: Use unique passwords for each site.

- **Phishing** – Tricks the user into revealing their password.  
  *Defense*: Be cautious with links, enable MFA.

##  How Password Complexity Affects Security
- **Longer passwords** drastically increase the number of possible combinations, making brute force attacks infeasible.
- **Mixing character types** (upper, lower, numbers, symbols) multiplies the possible variations, extending crack time.
- **Randomness** prevents dictionary and pattern-based attacks.
- **Unique passwords** ensure that a breach on one site doesn’t compromise other accounts.
- Complexity increases the **entropy** (unpredictability), which is the key factor in resisting automated attacks.
