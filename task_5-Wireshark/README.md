## Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

### ðŸ“Œ Objective
Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types. This task is designed to enhance packet analysis skills and improve awareness of how network protocols operate.

### ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Wireshark** (Free Network Protocol Analyzer)

### ðŸ“‚ Task Deliverables
- A packet capture file (`.pcap`)
- A short report summarizing the identified protocols and packet details

### ðŸ“– Process Overview
1. Install Wireshark on your system.
2. Start capturing packets on the active network interface.
3. Generate network activity by browsing websites or sending test network requests.
4. Stop the capture after sufficient data is collected.
5. Apply filters to view specific protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS, TCP).
6. Identify at least three different protocols in the captured traffic.
7. Export the capture file as a `.pcap`.
8. Summarize findings, including protocol types and notable packet details.

### ðŸŽ¯ Outcome
By completing this task, I gained:
- Hands-on experience in live packet capturing.
- Practical skills in filtering and analyzing specific types of network traffic.
- A stronger understanding of how different protocols behave in network communication.

### ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts
- Packet capture
- Protocol analysis
- TCP/IP
- Network troubleshooting
- Packet filtering.
